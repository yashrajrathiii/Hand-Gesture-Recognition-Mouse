# Abstract: - Gesture-controlled laptops and computers have recently gained a lot of attraction.
Leap motion is the name for this technique. Waving our hand in front of our computer/laptop
allows us to manage certain of its functionalities. Over slides and overheads, computer-based
presentations have significant advantages. Audio, video, and even interactive programs can be
used to improve presentations. Unfortunately, employing these techniques is more complicated
than using slides or overheads. The speaker must operate various devices with unfamiliar
controls (e.g., keyboard, mouse, VCR remote control). In the dark, these devices are difficult to
see, and manipulating them causes the presentation to be disrupted. Hand gestures are the most
natural and effortless manner of communicating. The camera’s output will be displayed on the
monitor. The concept is to use a simple camera instead of a classic or standard mouse to control
mouse cursor functions. The Virtual Mouse provides an infrastructure between the user and the
system using only a camera. It allows users to interface with machines without mechanical or
physical devices, and even control mouse functionalities. This study presents a method for
controlling the cursor’s position without the need for any electronic equipment.
